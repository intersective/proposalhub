  
[] Improve the current proposal UI
    [x] Move the company search form to the company section when there is no company yet. When the results come back just fill in the section but now have the accept / replace buttons. Any changes to this section should update the company in the database. Once accepted, there is an edit button that allows the user to change the company details or replace it with a new company via search.

    [x] Do the same for the client section.

    [] No improve button for empty sections. Put placeholder text in the section and shrink the vertical space the empty sections take up. 

    [] Allow sections to added, removed, collapsed, and reordered via dragging and dropping.
