# **Proposal for an AI-Driven Research & Publication System to deliver Section 111 CDR Reporting and more**

**For:** Massachusetts Clean Energy Technology Center (MassCEC)

**Delivery Date:** December 2025

**Submitted by:** Agent M Advisory

## **Executive Summary**

The Massachusetts Clean Energy Technology Center (MassCEC) is charged with conducting a comprehensive study to explore the prospects and opportunities for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) innovation and operations both within the Commonwealth and in nearby waters.

We propose to help MassCEC deliver this study by leveraging an AI-enhanced research platform that continuously enriches a detailed database of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) innovations using automated AI agents, integrated expert vetting, and a dual‑mode online publication tool. This tool will be reusable for future reports and can be generalized to domains beyond carbon removal.

Our solution is modular, built on proven and reliable AI and SaaS platforms. Our work will be executed by our lean, fractional consulting team with heavy AI‑augmentation—thereby shortening timeframes and focusing expert effort on guidance, verification, and proprietary insights.

To provide flexibility, we offer tiered "add‑on" options so MassCEC can consider different functionality mixes depending on budget and procurement requirements. These options can be decided upon up-front, or can be added on as the project progresses.

**Project Background**

MassCEC is charged with conducting a comprehensive study to explore the prospects and opportunities for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) innovation and operations both within the Commonwealth and in nearby waters (up to 50 nautical miles offshore). This study will evaluate a diverse portfolio of CDR approaches, including:

**Terrestrial Methods:** Sequestration and storage via natural processes such as terrestrial mineralization and enhanced rock weathering.

**Waste-Based Approaches:** Conversion of biochar, woody waste, agricultural residues, or other waste products into stable carbon storage.

**Ocean-Based Solutions:** Techniques including electro-chemical alkalinity enhancement, marine permaculture, deep-ocean biomass sequestration and storage, and coastal enhanced weathering.

**Construction Materials:** Innovations in building materials—such as mass timber and CO₂-infused concretes—that actively contribute to the sequestration and storage of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.

**Direct Air Capture (DAC):** Technologies that extract CO₂ from the ambient air, paired with durable storage solutions either in geologic formations or within the built environment.

### **Objectives of the Study:**

**Cost Analysis:** Determine the likely cost ranges per ton of CO₂ removed for each method, providing a detailed cost-benefit framework.

**Scale and Operational Potential:** Assess the scalability of various CDR processes and estimate the operational timelines, including the anticipated duration and start times of different activities.

**Resource Efficiency:** Evaluate the conservation efficiency of each approach in terms of water, land, and energy usage, with a focus on identifying projects that are particularly resource-efficient or that exclusively utilize renewable energy.

**Economic and Employment Impact:** Quantify the potential for job creation—including opportunities in research and development—within the Commonwealth, and assess the prospects for local business involvement through equipment and supply procurement.

**Environmental and Ecosystem Considerations:** Analyze the potential for both positive agricultural, ecological, and ecosystem co-benefits as well as any negative impacts, such as ocean acidification and effects on commercially important marine species like shellfish and lobsters.

**Community Benefits:** Investigate the extent to which various CDR activities might deliver economic benefits to disadvantaged communities.

**Measurement and Verification:** Develop robust methodologies for measuring, reporting, and verifying the performance of CDR technologies.

**Policy Recommendations:** Provide informed recommendations for legislative or executive action to support the deployment and scaling of effective carbon dioxide removal solutions.

This study will provide a critical roadmap for MassCEC and its stakeholders, delivering actionable insights into the technical, economic, and social dimensions of various carbon dioxide removal strategies and guiding future investments and policy decisions in the clean energy sector.

MassCEC is committed to leveraging advanced artificial intelligence to streamline the development and delivery of this critical report, thereby reducing costs and enhancing overall outcomes. By integrating AI-driven research systems that continuously mine and analyze diverse data sources—from academic journals and industry reports to policy documents—MassCEC will reduce the need for expensive and time-consuming manual data collection while accelerating insights generation.

**Project Scope**

The scope of this project is to meet the reporting requirements by developing a cost-effective and reusable system that can also improve future reports. Advanced natural language processing and machine learning algorithms will extract, structure, and synthesize complex information on carbon dioxide removal technologies, which will then be refined through a rigorous expert vetting process. This hybrid approach not only ensures high-quality, actionable data but also enables the creation of a dynamic, interactive reporting platform that offers both comprehensive downloadable reports and an engaging online explorer. Ultimately, this strategy positions MassCEC to deliver a robust, cost-effective study that informs strategic decision-making and lays the foundation for scalable, future research initiatives.

The following are the components of the system that will be used to generate the report:

**Automated Data Enrichment:**

* Deploy an AI‑agent system that continuously collects, parses, and enriches a comprehensive database of CDR innovations

**Expert Vetting:**

* Integrate a fractional expert review process to validate and refine the AI‑generated data

* Ensure actionable, high‑quality insights

**Online Publication Platform:**

* A web‑based tool that provides downloadable, comprehensive report

* An interactive data explorer (optional add‑on) for dynamic data filtering and visualization

**Modular, Scalable Design (optional add-on):**

* Ensure the system is built for rapid reconfiguration

* Enable adaptation for other research domains and future engagements
